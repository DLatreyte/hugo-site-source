## Fri 15 January 2021 - 18:00

Applications for *all UCAS Undergraduate courses*, **except those with a 15 October deadline**, should arrive at UCAS by 18:00 (UK time) on 15 January 2021.

This is our 'equal consideration' deadline, which means course providers must consider all applications received by this time equally. 

Universities and colleges do not have to consider applications received after the deadline, although they can if they have spaces available once the on-time applications have been considered. 

Check course information in our [search tool](https://digital.ucas.com/search) to see which deadline applies to you.
