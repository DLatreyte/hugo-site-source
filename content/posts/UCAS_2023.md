## 25 January 2023

Applications for the **majority of undergraduate courses should arrive at UCAS by 18:00 (UK time)** on the equal consideration date (check course details in our search tool for the correct deadline). The reference needs to be completed before the application can be sent to us.

Check course information in our search tool to see which deadline applies to you.

**Apply as soon as possible:** Student funding arrangements mean that as offers are made and places fill up, some courses may only have vacancies for students from certain locations. It’s therefore really important that you apply for your chosen courses by the appropriate deadlines mentioned above, as not all courses will have places for all students.
